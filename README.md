#Leetcode practice 

In this repository, I will be documenting my leetcode learning process.

I would like to be revisit the various questions I have attempted, and the various solutions I have come up with.

Each folder could refer to

1. One question. And the folder would include the question, and multiple solutions, and helper files.
2. A field of DSTA (dynamic programming for instance). The folder will include subfolders that then refer to each question and follow the structure stated in 1.

Hope this would be of help for you too!
